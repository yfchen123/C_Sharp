1. The difference between a namespace and an assembly is assemblies can contain many namespaces, so you can have many namespaces
in the same assembly but you cannot have many assemblies in the same namespace. Also a namespace may be defined in many 
assemblies. 

2. You can reference another project in the .csproj file by using the dotnet add package command to add a package to the current 
.csproj file.

3. The benefit of a tool like ILSpy is that it allows you to decompile any .NET assembly. 

4. C# float alias represents the .NET type of System.Single.

5. You should run the .NET upgrade assistant when porting from .NET Framework to modern .NET. 

6. The difference between framework dependent and self contained deployments of .NET applications is that
framework dependent apps must be executed from the dotnet command tool, whereas self contained apps do not rely on the dotnet 
framework.

7. A RID is a Runtime Identifier which identifies what OS you are running on.

8. dotnet pack creates a NuGet package for the project , dotnet publish builds and publishes the project. Note that dotnet pack 
does not publish the project.

9. The types of applications written for .NET Framework that can be ported to modern .NET are: ASP.NET Core websites, 
ASP.NET Core webservices, ASP.NET Core-hosted services, Console App command line interfaces, Windows Form Applications,
Windows Presentation Foundations, and Xamarin apps for Android and IOS.

10. Yes you can use packages published for .NET Framework on modern .NET because modern .NET has more features and include all the 
features of the previous versions so it is backwards compatiable.
