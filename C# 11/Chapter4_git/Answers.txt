1. Void in C# means the method does not return anything.

2. In functional programming you have no side effects or state changes, whereas these are common 
in imperative programming. In imperative programming you provide a number of steps for a program to 
execute so it can accomplish a goal, in functional programming you compose the program into a number 
of functions to be executed.

3. F5 just refreshes the page, shift F5 and cmd + shift + F5 refreshes the page but ignores cached 
content so it will reload the page completely from scratch regardless of what was cached.

4. Trace.WriteLine() writes to the trace listeners in the Listeners Collection.

5. The five trace levels are: off, error, warning, info and verbose.

6. Trace class is generally used to trace the execution of the program during deployment and works 
in both debug mode as well as release mode. Debug class is used during the development time of the 
application and only works in debug mode. 

7. The three A's when writing a unit test are: Arrange - Declare and instantiate variables for input and 
output, Act - Execute the part you are testing, and Assert - Make one or more assertions to the output
if this fails it means the assumptions are incorrect.

8. When writing a unit test with xUnit you must decorate the test methods with [Fact] attribute.

9. The dotnet test command executes xUnit tests. 

10. You use the throw keyword to rethrow a caught exception without losing the stack trace.
