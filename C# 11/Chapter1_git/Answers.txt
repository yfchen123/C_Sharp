1. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2022 are different coding platform, Visual Studio Code is 
a text editor, and Visual Studio 2022 is an IDE neither are superior to the other one.

2. .NET 5 is later and better than .NET Framework.

3. .NET Standard is an older framework that is used to achieve greater unity in the .NET ecosystem. 
If you need to share code between legacy systems like .NET Framework and modern systems like .NET
Core then .NET Standard is required.

4. These languages all have a compiler that translates the source code into IL or Intermediate Language 
code which the .NET platform supports.

5. A top-level program is a program where the boiler plate such as the main method, and 
the program class are generated for you. You can use the Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() to get the 
command line arguments.

6. The entry point of a .NET console app is the Program.cs file. If you are not using a top-level feature
you need to explictly declare it with:
The namespace, the class Program, and finally the Main method. 

7. You use dotnet run to build and execute C# source code.

8. In Interactive Notebooks you can combine markdown and C# code blocks to create an open source library,
prototyping public APIs, or having multi language support within the same tool and notebook file.

9. You would go to the Microsoft C# documentation to look for help on a C# keyword.

10. You would go to StackOverflow and type the error and see if it already has a solution. 
If it does not, you go to BingAI and ChatGPT to see if they can solve the problem for you.
