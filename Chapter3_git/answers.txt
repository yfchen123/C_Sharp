1. When you divide an int variable by 0, you get an error saying division by constant zero.

2. When you divide a double by 0, you get an error saying division by constant zero.

3. You get an error saying integral constant is too large.

4. x = y++ is a post-increment operator and x = ++y is a pre-increment operator, post-increment increments
the value of y after it is assigned to x, and pre-increment increments the value of y before it is 
assigned to x.

5. Break breaks the loop so it would exit the loop, contiune goes to the next iteration of the loop, so you
don't execute the remaining statements in this iteration of the loops. The return statement would exit 
the whole method and not execute the rest of the body of the method when used inside of a loop.

6. The three parts of the for loop are the intialization, the termination condition and the increment amount.
None of the parts are required, if you do a for(;;) it creates an infinite loop.

7. = is used for assignment so if you use the = operator you are assigning something to a variable. 
== is a comparison operator that checks if two values or variables are equal.

8. Yes it compiles and just hangs the terminal forever since it is an infinite for loop.

9. The _ represents the default case in a switch statement.

10. To make an object enumerated over a foreach statement you must implement the IEnumerator interface.

11. You get an infinite loop because once the value exceeds 255 it wraps back to 0 again. I can wrap the 
code in a checked statement which will cause it to throw an arithmetic operation resulted in an 
overflow exception. 

12. y should be 6. x should be 4.

13. y should be 5. x should be 12.

14. y should be 15. x should be 8.
