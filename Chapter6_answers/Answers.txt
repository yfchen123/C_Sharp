1. A delegate is a pointer to a method's memory address that contains the same signature as the delegate.

2. An event is an action that happens to an object.

3. A derived class inherits the methods from the base class. You use the base keyword to access members of a 
base class from a derived class. 

4. The is operator checks if an object is a certain type so it is a boolean operator that returns either true or false,
the as operator casts an object of one type to another type.

5. The sealed keyword is used to prevent a class from been derived from or a method from been overriden.

6. The abstract keyword prevents a class from been instantiated.

7. The virtual keyword allows a member to be overriden.

8. A destructor deallocates memory for an object, whereas a deconstructer assigns a list of variables to a tuple.

9. All exceptions must have one the following three public constructors: public NewException(), 
public NewException(String), or public NewException(String, Exception)

10. An extension method is a method that allows you to extended sealed types. You define an extension method 
by making your class static and also adding a this keyword in front of the method parameters you define.
