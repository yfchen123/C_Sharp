1. The File class creates a file that you can modify whereas the FileInfo class allows you to get more information about a 
file or directory such as its size or when it was last accessed.

2. The ReadByte method reads a single byte and advances the position in the stream by one, the Read method reads a sequence 
of bytes and advances the stream by the number of bytes there are. 

3. You use StringReader when you are reading from a string, TextReader is an abstract base class for both StringReader and 
StreamReader so you won't call it directly, you use StreamReader when you need to read from a Stream. 

4. The DeflateStream class provides methods and properties for compressing and decompressing streams by using the Deflate algorithm.

5. UTF-8 character uses variable number of bytes per character depending on if it is part of the English alphabet, 
if it is an emoji or some other symbol.

6. An object graph is multiple objects that are related to each other either though a direct reference or indirectly by a 
chain of references.

7. The best serialization format to choose in order to minimize space requirements is JSON which is more compact and best for 
web and mobile applications.

8. Use XML if you want to achieve the best cross-platform compatiability. 

9. The backslash character is used to escape characters so using backslashes in file paths is extremely error-prone and using a 
verbitam string is better.
